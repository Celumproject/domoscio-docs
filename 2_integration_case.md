This document will walk you through the main steps to integrate the "Adaptive Learning Solution" into your platform.

# What do you need?
In order to proceed, you have to make sure that you have the following requirements:

*	A working e-learning or LMS platform
*	Credentials to connect to Domoscio's adaptive learning engine API
*	An HTTP requester to try out your request before implementing them
*	Basic knowledge of how to construct a HTTP request and what are 

Before starting, you can check if a SDK already exists to connect to the API for your programming language. 
For instance, if you are lucky enough that you're platform is coded with Ruby, we can use the [SDK](https://github.com/Celumproject/domoscio_rails) that we developped to connect the API to our White Label solution. Otherwise you can always refer to this library to get inspired!

## Get your credentials anc connect to the API

Request your API credentiels and you will receive:

1. An instance_id
2. An api_key

With these two elements you can start communicating with the API and requesting some information. The way to do this is to get your favorite HTTP requester and to ping a URL that we will build the following way:

# Integrating the API into your platform

Let us start actually work on the integration of the API into your platform. In order to fully describe the process we will highlight two parts: information that you will need to provide to the API and information that you might be receiving from the API.


## Information you need to send to the API

In this part, we focus on what your application should declare to the API in order to be able to make its computation and deliver its adaptive learning functionnalities. For the main part of this section, the method that you will be using is:

	HTTP Method: POST 

If everything goes well with your request, you shall receive a:

	OK RESPONSE 200

or simply a json object describing the newly created object:

	{name: "Mathematics", uid: "mat0036grde", created_at: [Now]}

Amongst all the types of information you should send to the API, the following three are mandatory. In some cases, the "Contents structure and meta-data" can be imported directly into the API. If that is your case or if you are willing to do so, please contact us directly.
### Contents structure and meta-data 


### Students and subscriptions
#### Students
The Student is the object on Domoscio's API that represent the users that are learning something on your platform. This object is obviously central and necessary for the application to do the proper computations. 
Creating a Student is a simple as requesting a POST method on the Student Index URL:

	Method: POST
	URL: HOST_URL/instances/{instance_id}/students

If everything goes well, you should be receiving the following answer depending on what you actually sent to the API:

	{
		"id": 48,
		"uid": "my_first_student",
		"civil_profile_attributes": {
			"name": "John Doe",  (Optional)
			"sexe": "male",  (Optional)
			"day_of_birth": "1970/01/01"  (Optional)
		},
		"student_group_id": "1" (Optional)
	}
	

Once you created your first user, you can start focusing on creating a bridge between your Student and your KnowledgeNode so that you can start declaring Event!

#### Links between a User and a piece of knowledge (KnowledgeNode)
All user activity related to content is mastered by KnowledgeNodeStudent. They operate also as a permission controller between a Student and a Content. Their existence mean that a Student is entitled to access this piece of Content.

![User Enrollment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Celumproject/domoscio-docs/master/uploads/user_enrollment.jpg)

*	Unique : Can be considered as a student subscription to a piece of Ressource
*	Smart: Carry all user data : results, analysis, computationsâ€¦
*	Simple: Use this object to record all student events

Creating a KnowledgeNodeStudent is, as usual, done through this example of request:

	 Method: POST
	 URL: HOST_URL/instances/{instance_id}/knowledge_node_students

The response you will be receiving is something like:

	{
		"id": 547,
		"knowledge_node_id": 45,
		"student_id": 12,
		"uid": "kns1" (Optional)
	}

Once you created your first KnowledgeNodeStudent object, you are all set to start declaring Event and going further.

### Events and users interactions with your platform

Every user activity can trigger the creation of an Event Object. The most basic one is an Event generated by the correct or wrong answer of a question. To specify what kind of Event you want to declare, the API uses a "type" attribute. In the case af a result to a question the type would be **EventResult**. Sending such an Event will trigger the API to store and process it in order to deliver its adaptive learning functionalities.

![User Event](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Celumproject/domoscio-docs/master/uploads/user_event.jpg)

As explained previously, Events are linked to a KnowledgeNodeStudent Object. Hence, to declare a new Event to the API you might just want to do:

	 Method: POST
	 URL: HOST_URL/instances/{instance_id}/events

	 {
	 	"knowledge_node_student": 65,
	 	"type": "EventResult",
		"standard": nil, (Can be "xAPI")
	 	"payload": "100"
	 }


Here are the easiest steps to interact, declare and create objects in Domoscio's API. Next, we will go through what you can expect and receive from this API.

## What you can receive from the API

### Reviews engine
In order to provide to your user an automated, personnalized and optimized revision plan you can request from Domoscio's API, all the reviews for a specific student. To do this you might want to use the "Utils" class.

For instance:

	 Method: GET
	 URL: HOST_URL/instances/{instance_id}/review_utils/?student_id={student_id}
