There are two ways to gather Students. 
The first one comes from the administrator: it can be used to gather all the learners from the same departement, or with the same mission for instance. It is an administrative gathering, and it is called **Student Group**.
The other one is created thanks to algorithms, as as to indicate the Students who look alike a specified Student. That gathering is called **Student Cluster** and it is indicated through **Student Cluster Membership**.

# Student Group

# Student Cluster

Each Student has a Student Cluster which contains the Students who are similar to him/her. In other words, a Student Cluster is specific to one Student. One should notice that if Students A and B are similar to Student C, it does not imply that Students A and B look alike.
