# Events
Once all the management layers and knowledge’s structure are declared, you can start registering all your student’s data and retrieve their statistics on our API. Hence, you can declare Event objects and manage them. For instance, if you need to store results, you can declare an Event object with a EventResult type. <br/><br/>
The only constraint for the consolidation feature is that you must register your Event as EventResult type and the payload should be either “0” or “100”. For the adaptive learning functionality, the more types we have and the more precise is the payload, the more accurate we are doing recommendations. <br/><br/>
