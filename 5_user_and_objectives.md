Now everything related to the Content and its organization is set. The **Students** can start using them. The **Knowledge Node Students** help us to structure the User Model.
Those Student will want to follow an **Objective**; this task is related to them thanks to an **Objective Student**.

# Objective

An Objective is a set of Knowledge Node which all have a threshold of comprehension. An Objective can be reached when, for each its Knowledge Nodes, the student’s mastery is above the threshold.
It is possible to activate the learning consolidation on that Objective : when some point is mastered, it will trigger the beginning of the reviewing for that point.
